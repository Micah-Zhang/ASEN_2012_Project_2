%
% Purpose: To determine the flight paramters that will allow the bottle
% rocket to land within 1 meter of 75-meter mark.
%
% Inputs: None
%
% Outputs: This program calculates the maximum distance and height
% traversed by the bottle rocket using the given set of parameters. It then
% outputs these values to the screen. It also produced two plots, a plot of
% the trajectory of the bottle rocket and a plot of the thrust profile with
% time over the flight, with markers on the plot to indicate where the
% transition between the three phases of flight occur.
%
% Assumptions: It is assumed that the experimental procedure outlined in 
% the report is valid. It is also assumed that ODE45 should be used to
% accomplish the above task.
