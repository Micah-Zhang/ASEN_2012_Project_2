% Purpose: To calculate the trajectory of the rocket given a set of intitial
% conditions. More specifically, this function produces a set of rates for
% ODE45 to use for numeric integration.
%
% Inputs: This program takes two inputs, a time value t, and a vector x
% that contains values for the position in the x and z direction, velocity
% in the x and z direction, the volume of air in the rocket, the mass of 
% air in the rocket, and the mass of the rocket at a given time t.
%
% Outputs: This function uses the numerous equations provided in the project
% description along with the input vector x to produce the following rates:
% the rate of change of distance with time, the rate of change of height
% with time, the rate of change of velocity with time (acceleration), the
% rate of change of the volume of air in the rocket with time, the rate of 
% change of the mass of air in the rocket with time, and the rate of change
% of the mass of the rocket with time all at a given time t. These rates
% are then fed into ODE45 to allow it to produce a vector of distances and
% heights which can then be used to plot the trajectory of the rocket.
%
% Assumptions: It is assumed that the experimental procedure outlined in 
% the report is valid.
